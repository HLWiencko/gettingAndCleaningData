========================================================================

This repo contains scripts and data for the peer-reviewed assignment for "Getting and Cleaning Data." 

## Data
The original data set is taken from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Scripts

## Documentation
`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, data, and changes made to the original data to create the tidy data set. 

## Results
The output from `run_analysis.R` is in `tidyAverages.txt.`
